# Example Jupyter workbook

This repo is my first try with Jupyter workbooks on Github.

# Jupyter app
If you're having Jupyter installed with `pip install jupyter` or with Conda.
You can run `jupyter notebook` in your terminal. It will open a web editor of your Jupyter notebooks.

It's pretty similar to the VS Code plugin but in Code it's easier to work.

## Todos
- [ ] Is it possible to create a Github pages from Notebooks? What tooling is required?
- [ ] Create a test workbook:
    - [x] %matplotlib widget is not rendering on Github - was just adding text in a pre-tag
    - [ ] %matplotlib inline?
